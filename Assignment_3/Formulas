 1. Area Formulas

- Area of Circle:
  A = πr²
  where `r` is the radius.

- Area of Triangle:
  A = 1/2 × base × height

- Area of Rectangle:
  A = length × width

- Area of Isosceles Triangle:
  A = 1/2 × base × height

- Area of Parallelogram:
  A = base × height

- Area of Rhombus:
  A = 1/2 × d₁ × d₂
  where d₁ and d₂ are the lengths of the diagonals.

- Area of Equilateral Triangle:
  A = (√3 / 4) × a²
  where a is the length of a side.

2. Perimeter Formulas

- Perimeter of Circle (Circumference):
  P = 2πr

- Perimeter of Equilateral Triangle:
  P = 3a
  where a is the length of a side.

- Perimeter of Parallelogram:
  P = 2(a + b)
  where a and b are the lengths of the adjacent sides.

- Perimeter of Rectangle:
  P = 2(length + width)

- Perimeter of Square:
  P = 4a
  where a is the length of a side.

- Perimeter of Rhombus:
  P = 4a
  where a is the length of a side.

 3. Volume Formulas

- Volume of Cone:
  V = 1/3 × πr²h
  where r is the radius of the base and h is the height.

- Volume of Prism:
  V = Base Area × h
  where h is the height of the prism.

- Volume of Cylinder:
  V = πr²h
  where r is the radius of the base and h is the height.

- Volume of Sphere:
  V = 4/3 × πr³

- Volume of Pyramid:
  V = 1/3 × Base Area × h
  where h is the height of the pyramid.

4. Surface Area Formulas

- Curved Surface Area of Cylinder:
  A = 2πrh
  where r is the radius of the base and h is the height.

- Total Surface Area of Cube:
  A = 6a²
  where a is the length of a side.
